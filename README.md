# Intelligent-Traffic-Control-System
A project created to develop an Intelligent traffic Control System using an Arduino

This project was made for the Tecnology and Computer Arquiteture curricular Unit in the Instituicao da Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestao de Oliveira do Hospital

The objective of the project is to develope an Intelligent Traffic Control System to manage Traffic lights and public ilumination, using an Arduino we apply the concept of FSM(Finite State Machine), Interruptions, millis(), PWM and a 7 segment display

<b> Materials </b>
  - Arduino UNO
  - LEDs(red, yellow, green) to simulate Traffic Lights
  - 2 Push buttons
  - Ultrazonic Sensor SR04
  - Buzzer
  - LDR
  - White LED
  - 7 segment Display
  - Resistences, jumper cables and a breadboard
